## Abstract

## Motivation

For example, suppose we had this data:

```
{"first_choice": "WA",
 "states": [
   {"name": "WA", "cities": ["Seattle", "Bellevue", "Olympia"]},
   {"name": "CA", "cities": ["Los Angeles", "San Francisco"]},
   {"name": "NY", "cities": ["New York City", "Albany"]},
 ]
}
```
## Specification

Describe the grammar changes or new functions.

## Rationale

Why problems is this JEP addressing?
Has alternatives been considered?

## Implementation Survey

*Omit this section if not relevant*

Provide a minimal demonstration of how the proposed functionality would be implemented for each programming language.
Include links to any proposed dependencies. This is to ensure that each language can support the proposed functionality, allows for
the review of any additional dependencies that would need to be included with each implementation, provides reference for implementers,
and ensures that each proposed implementation in each language has consistent behaviour across all languages.
